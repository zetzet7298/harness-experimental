# Harness

The project goal is to provide an operating harness that lets humans and agents
turn brownfield H5 game work into safe, validated, documented changes.

The app is what users touch. The harness is what agents touch.

## Mental Model

```text
------------------+
| Human intent    |
+------------------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| Feature intake   |
+------------------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| Story packet     |
+------------------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| Agent work loop  |
+------------------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| Product delta    |
+------------------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| Validation proof |
+------------------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| Harness delta    |
+------------------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| Next intent      |
+------------------+
```

Every task has two possible outputs:

1. Product delta: app code, tests, API shape, data model, or product docs.
2. Harness delta: docs, templates, validation expectations, backlog items, or
   decision records that make the next task easier.

## Harness v0 Scope

Harness v0 now controls a brownfield implementation that lives outside this Git
root at `/var/www/vltk-h5-survivors/game-source`. It includes:

- Agent entrypoint.
- Product documentation for the current H5 prototype.
- Feature intake and risk lanes.
- Story templates and selected brownfield story packets.
- Decision log template.
- Validation report template.
- Test matrix rows for current prototype and VHCND porting gates.
- Harness growth backlog.

Harness v0 deliberately excludes:

- A monolithic project-specific `SPEC.md`.
- Moving game-source implementation files into this harness repo.
- Backend, database, auth, CI, deployment, or native shell scaffolding.
- CI workflows.
- Database migrations or infrastructure.

Those should arrive only when a selected story needs them.

## Source Hierarchy

```text
User-provided spec or prompt
  input material for first buildout or future changes

docs/product/*
  current product contract derived from accepted input

docs/stories/*
  story-sized work packets and historical evidence

docs/TEST_MATRIX.md
  behavior-to-proof control panel

docs/decisions/*
  why the contract changed
```

Before implementation, product docs describe intent. After implementation,
product docs plus executable tests become the living contract.

## Spec Lifecycle

This project is currently driven by a brownfield prompt and inspected source
state rather than a tracked monolithic spec. Treat the current game-source state,
user prompts, product docs, story packets, validation reports, and decisions as
the living contract.

After the specification has been decomposed, do not keep extending it as the
living product plan. Ongoing work should update the smaller product docs,
stories, test matrix, and decision records.

Ongoing work should enter the harness as one of these input types:

- New spec: a project specification that needs to become product docs and
  initial story candidates.
- Spec slice: a selected behavior from the provided spec.
- Change request: a bounded behavior change, bug fix, or product refinement.
- New initiative: a larger product area that needs multiple stories.
- Maintenance request: dependency, architecture, performance, security, or
  operational work.
- Harness improvement: a process, template, proof, or agent-instruction change.

The spec-to-work loop is:

```text
human intent or supplied spec
  -> classify input type
  -> update or create product contract
  -> create story packet or initiative notes when needed
  -> define validation proof
  -> implement or document the blocker
  -> update product docs, stories, test matrix, and decisions
  -> capture harness friction
```

Large product areas should use scoped initiative notes instead of a second
monolithic specification. An initiative should explain the goal, affected
product docs, candidate stories, validation shape, open decisions, and exit
criteria. If initiative work becomes a repeated pattern, add a template or
proposal to `docs/HARNESS_BACKLOG.md`.

## Growth Rule

The harness grows from friction.

When an agent is confused, repeats manual reasoning, needs a new validation
command, discovers a missing rule, or sees a recurring failure pattern, it must
either improve the harness directly or add a proposal to `HARNESS_BACKLOG.md`.

## Future Validation Ladder

Current game-source validation commands include `npm run typecheck`,
`npm run build`, and `python3 tests/test_vltk_porting_smoke.py`. Future validation
should grow toward this ladder as stories need it:

```text
validate:quick
  format, lint, typecheck, unit tests, architecture check

test:integration
  backend, database, provider, or service checks as the stack requires

test:e2e
  user-visible end-to-end flows

test:platform
  shell, mobile, desktop, or deployment smoke checks as the stack requires

test:release
  full suite, log checks, and performance smoke
```

Agents must not claim these commands pass until they exist and have been run.
